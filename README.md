[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

Lock-Facebook helps you integrate native Login with [Facebook Android SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk) and [Lock](https://auth0.com/lock)

## Requierements

Android 4.0 or later.

## Install

The Lock-Facebook is available through [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org) and [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). To install it, simply add the following line to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
compile 'com.auth0.android:lock-facebook:2.4.+'
```

Then in your project's `AndroidManifest.xml` add the following entries:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity"
          android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
          android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"
          android:label="@string/app_name" />
<meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
```

The value `@string/facebook_app_id` is your Facebook Application ID that you can get from [Facebook Dev Site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) after you create your Facebook Application. Then just add this value in your `strings.xml` like this:

```xml
<string name="facebook_app_id">YOUR_FB_APP_ID_GOES_HERE</string>
```

> For more information please check [Facebook Getting Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started).

## Usage

Just create a new instance of `FacebookIdentityProvider`

```java
    FacebookIdentityProvider facebook = new FacebookIdentityProvider();
```

and register it with your instance of `Lock`

```java
Lock lock = ...;
lock.setProvider(Strategies.Facebook.getName(), facebook);
```

* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
